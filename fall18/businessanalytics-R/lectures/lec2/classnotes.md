- Quadratic regression lin300lec1.R
- analysis for bwgt and smoking
	- problems with linear relationships showing significance for data
	- switch to an analysis for smokers only
	- significance for bgender shows a weird pattern between model 7 and 8
		> male has a negative coeff for model8 contrary to normal patterns
	- inconclusivity of relationships

- trying to establish if the relationship is binary


-- log models are showing a percentage change instead of a linear relation despite being a general linear regression model
-- line 334
