#  how to: multi-group assignment
#
# scenario:
#     An observation needs to be assigned to 1 of several groups.  The values
#     relating to each group are already present in a matrix (or dataframe).
#     From these values, you want to find the location of the min (or max) and
#     the corresponding value. Location will indicate group membership.
